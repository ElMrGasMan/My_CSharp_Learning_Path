# Hey, this is just my C# stuff that I do.


There isn't any big proyects here, I will just put all the files I create while I learn the language.

Maybe this will be interesting for someone, or be usefull for my portfolio, I don't really know.

**Oh, and also something important, there will be *some* Spanish because it's my first language but *most* of
the code should be in English.**



  ***I know it's called "FirstProjConsol" or something like that but don't take that into consideration!!!***
